# PowerApp using local storage

This is a tutorial on how to create a Power App for presenting content like tutorials.

There are a number of so called 'Learning Management Systems', but most are way over architected, not easy for the end user, Admin, and definitely not easy for following instructions.

So, I created one.

Features of the app:

- It is fully self-contained, no remote data store to pull from
- Your progress is saved between sessions
- You can reset a step or your entire progress
- Only 1 screen was used, I hate screen navigation flicker
- Uses experimental feature for Save/Load within the web player
- Note this is a tablet app and not intended to be used on a phone

Hopefully you'll find this a useful tool and perhaps learn something new along the way.

Enjoy,
Dale
