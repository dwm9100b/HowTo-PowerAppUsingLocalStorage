# PowerApp using local storage

![PowerAppUsingLocalStorage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2302848/238690780-fc360b5a-71fa-48eb-becf-65bd56e662fe.png)

This is a tutorial on how to create a Power App for presenting content like tutorials.

There are a number of so called 'Learning Management Systems', but most are way over architected, not easy for the end user, Admin, and definitely not easy for following instructions.

So, I created one.

Features of the app:

- It is fully self-contained, no remote data store to pull from
- Your progress is saved between sessions
- You can reset a step or your entire progress
- Only 1 screen was used, I hate screen navigation flicker
- Uses experimental feature for Save/Load within the web player
- Note this is a tablet app and not intended to be used on a phone

Hopefully you'll find this a useful tool and perhaps learn something new along the way.

To use:

1. Click on the green "Code" button above
2. Click on Download ZIP
3. Unzip the downloaded zip
4. Note where you downloaded this zip
5. From within your PowerApp studio
6. Select Apps in the left nav
7. From the top nav, select Import canvas app
8. When asked, navigate to the unzipped location
9. Select the app zip file
10. Then follow the prompts
11. Once imported, publish and run the app

Enjoy,
Dale
