# PowerApp using local storage

This is a tutorial on how to create a Power App for presenting content like tutorials.

There are a number of so called 'Learning Management Systems', but most are way over architected, not easy for the end user, Admin, and definitely not easy for following instructions.

So, I created one.

Features of the app:

- It is fully self-contained, no remote data store to pull from
- Your progress is saved between sessions
- You can reset a step or your entire progress
- Only 1 screen was used, I hate screen navigation flicker
- Uses experimental feature for Save/Load within the web player
- Note this is a tablet app and not intended to be used on a phone

Hopefully you'll find this a useful tool and perhaps learn something new along the way.

To use:

1. Right side of the GitHub page
2. Under the Releases section
3. Click on the latest release
4. You'll be taken to the release page
5. Click on the **PowerAppUsingLocalStorage.zip** file
6. Download should start, note the download location
7. From within your PowerApp studio
8. Select Apps in the left nav
9. From the top toolbar, select Import canvas app
10. When asked, navigate to the download location
11. Select the **PowerAppUsingLocalStorage.zip** file
12. Then follow the prompts
13. Once imported, publish and run the app

Enjoy,
