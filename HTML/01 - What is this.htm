        This is a tutorial on how to create a Power App for presenting content like tutorials.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a number of so called 'Learning Management Systems', but most are way over 
        architected, not easy for the end user, Admin, and definitely not easy for following instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, I created one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Features of the app:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>It is fully self-contained, no remote data store to pull from</li>
        <li>Your progress is saved between sessions</li>
        <li>You can reset a step or your entire progress</li>
        <li>Only 1 screen was used, I hate screen navigation flicker</li>
        <li>Uses experimental feature for Save/Load within the web player</li>
        <li>Note this is a tablet app and not intended to be used on a phone</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Hopefully you'll find this a useful tool and perhaps learn something new along the way.
