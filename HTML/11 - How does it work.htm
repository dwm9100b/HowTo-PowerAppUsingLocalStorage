<!-- How does it work.htm -->
<div style='width: 650px; margin-top: 0px;'>
    <p style='margin-top: 0px;'>In the App.OnStart property, you will edit gblAppTitle, gblDataFile and colMenuItems</p>
    <p>Each line item should represent a page of content and will show in the left gallery</p>
    <p>If your line item has intTime > 0, then this will be displayed in its associated menu item</p>
    <p>Completed button will only display if a line item has intTime > 0</p>
    <p>Completed button is a toggle, Completed/Reset Completed</p>
    <p>On first run of the app, a local storage data file is created with the menu items</p>
    <p>Completed status is stored in the local storage data file</p>
    <p>Since the content is HTML based, you can use your imagination on your page content</p>
    <p>If you decide to delete the data file, make sure to close and reload the app</p>
    <p>You will add any number of Html text controls based on your colMenuItems line items</p>
    <p>Make sure to update in OnStart the name you want to use for your data file</p>
    <p>If you have run the app, then make changes to colMenuItems, you need to delete the data file before the changes are created, do this from the Admin stuff page of the app</p>
    <p>When working on the individual pages, its easiest to hold the Alt key down, select the page in the gallery. This will show that pages html control. You can then click on the html control in the Tree view and watch the live updates as you edit your content.</p>
